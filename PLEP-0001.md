## Introduction

PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposals (PLEPs) are design documents that
may provide information to the PlasmaPy community, describe
decision-making processes, or propose major changes or enhancements to
the code.  PLEPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for
proposing major changes to the direction of PlasmaPy, collecting
community feedback, and documenting the reasoning behind major decisions. 

## Types of PLEPs

There are three primary types of PLEPs:

* A **standard** PLEP introduces and describes a major change to the
  PlasmaPy code base.  Standard PLEPs may describe a new feature or
  subpackage, major changes to an existing package, or a backwards
  incompatible change to the application programming interface (API).
  A standard PLEP will start out as a proposal and eventually evolve
  into a design document if accepted.

* A **process** PLEP describes a new process or change to an existing
  process in the management and coordination of PlasmaPy.  Examples
  include changes to PlasmaPy decision-making processes or management
  structure, guidelines, or procedures.  A process PLEP will start out
  as a proposal and eventually involve into a document on the
  governance of PlasmaPy.

* An **informational** PLEP provides information and does not describe any
  changes.

## PLEP workflow

A PLEP may come about when a contributor has an idea for how to
improve PlasmaPy or when a Coordinating Committee member or subpackage
maintainer requests a PLEP to be written before a pull request is
accepted. The following subsections describe the procedure for PLEPs
to be created, submitted, decided upon, amended, and implemented.

### Creating a PLEP

A PLEP should contain a clear, concise, and well-organized description
of a new idea or proposal.  PLEPs should focus on a single topic,
except when there are multiple closely related topics.  The intended
audience of each PLEP is the overall PlasmaPy community.  PLEPs should
be written to be understandable to general members of the PlasmaPy
community rather than core contributors, though technical details
should be included when necessary (e.g., when describing the
implementation procedure).

PLEPs are generally not needed for minor changes.  PLEPs are more
likely to be needed for changes that break backwards compatibility,
especially after the release of version `1.0.0` or for stable
subpackages before then.

All new PLEPs should begin with a copy of the PLEP template contained
within the PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs repository.  This copy should be
renamed to `PLEP-nnnn.md` where `nnnn` is the lowest available PLEP
number preceded by zeros.

Not all sections included in the template are required for every PLEP,
and sometimes it is appropriate to include different sections.  PLEPs
are written in Markdown.

### Amending a PLEP

PLEPs are living documents that may be amended or superseded as
PlasmaPy evolves.

If a topic is already covered by an existing PLEP, then it is
often appropriate to propose an amendment to an existing PLEP.
Amendments to PLEPs go through the same process as newly proposed
PLEPs for community feedback and acceptance.  Proposed amendments
should update the "date last revised" category in the header.
Amendments should not substantially change the spirit of the PLEP.

When major changes to a PLEP are desired, then it is most appropriate
to propose a new PLEP to supercede the old PLEP.  The pull request to
supersede a PLEP should change the "status" category in the header of
the old PLEP to "superseded by PLEP nn" where nn is the number of the
new PLEP.

When PLEPs are amended or superseded, it is generally helpful to
request reviews from the authors of the original PLEP.

Minor changes to a PLEP that do not affect its meaning or intent (e.g.,
formatting changes and fixes to typos) do not need to go through the
full review process but should be reviewed by the Coordinating
Committee.

### Submitting a PLEP

All new PLEPs and amendments to PLEPs should be submitted by
[creating a pull request into the PlasmaPy-PLEP repository](). 

All new PLEPs and amendments to PLEPs should be submitted into the
[PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEP repository]() as pull requests.  The pull
request may be created while the PLEP is being written to allow for
greater community input during the writing process.

### Review process

When a new PLEP is submitted, the proposer should send out an email
to the PlasmaPy email list that introduces it and requests community
feedback.  Newly submitted standard and process PLEPs should be
discussed through normal communication channels such as 


Newly submitted PLEPs should be discussed through normal development
channels, including as comments on the pull request on GitHub,
discussions on Matrix, and during regularly scheduled PlasmaPy
meetings.  Important points and meeting minutes from should be
recorded as comments on the pull request so that the community
discussion is archived as much as possible. 

The PlasmaPy Coordinating Committee is tasked with
