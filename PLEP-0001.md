## Introduction

PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposals (PLEPs) are design documents that
provide information to the PlasmaPy community, describe
decision-making processes, or propose major changes or enhancements to
the code.  PLEPs are intended to be the primary mechanism for
proposing major changes to the direction of PlasmaPy, collecting
community feedback, and documenting the reasoning behind major
decisions.

## Types of PLEPs

There are three primary types of PLEPs:

* A **standard** PLEP introduces and describes a major change to the
  PlasmaPy code base.  Standard PLEPs may describe a new feature or
  subpackage, major changes to an existing package, or a backwards
  incompatible change to the application programming interface (API).
  A standard PLEP will start out as a proposal and eventually evolve
  into a design document if accepted.

* A **process** PLEP describes a new process or change to an existing
  process in the management and coordination of PlasmaPy.  Examples
  include changes to PlasmaPy decision-making processes or management
  structure, guidelines, or procedures.  A process PLEP will start out
  as a proposal and eventually evolve into a document on the
  governance of PlasmaPy.

* An **informational** PLEP provides information and does not describe any
  changes.

## PLEP workflow

A PLEP may come about when a contributor has an idea for how to
improve PlasmaPy or when a Coordinating Committee member or subpackage
maintainer requests a PLEP to be written before a pull request is
accepted. The following subsections describe the procedure for PLEPs
to be created, submitted, decided upon, amended, and implemented.
Anyone who abides by the code of conduct may submit a PLEP.

### Creating a PLEP

Before writing a PLEP, it is generally advisable to bring up your idea
on the Matrix channel and with the Coordinating Committee and/or subpackage
maintainers to get initial feedback.

A PLEP should contain a clear, concise, and well-organized description
of a new idea or proposal.  PLEPs should generally focus on a single
topic.  PLEPs should be written to be understandable to general
members of the PlasmaPy community rather than just core contributors
and Coordinating Committee members.  However, technical details should
be included when needed (e.g., when describing details about how a
proposed change should be implemented).

Standard PLEPs are generally only needed for major improvements to the
code base such as significant restructuring of the code base or
adoption of a new standard.  PLEPs are more likely to be needed for
changes that break backwards compatibility, especially for stable
subpackages in development releases and after the release of version
`1.0.0`.  PLEPs are not needed for minor changes.  

All new PLEPs should begin with a copy of the PLEP template contained
within the PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs repository.  This copy should be
renamed to `PLEP-nnnn.md` where `nnnn` should be the lowest PLEP number
preceded by zeros that has not been tentatively or permanently assigned
by the Coordinating Committee.  The template contains a suggested outline
that is most appropriate for a standard PLEP.  Not all sections
included in the template are required for every PLEP, and sometimes it
is appropriate to create different sections.  PLEPs are written in
Markdown.

### Amending or superceding a PLEP

PLEPs may be amended or superceded as PlasmaPy grows and changes.

If a topic is already covered by an existing PLEP, then it is often
appropriate to propose an amendment to that PLEP instead of writing a
new PLEP.  Amendments should not substantially change the spirit of
the PLEP.  Proposed amendments should update the "date last revised"
category in the header.  Amendments to PLEPs go through the same
process as newly proposed PLEPs.

When major changes to a PLEP are desired, then it is most appropriate
to propose a new PLEP to supercede the old PLEP.  The pull request to
supersede a PLEP should change the "status" category in the header of
the old PLEP to "superseded by PLEP N" where N is the number of the
new PLEP not preceded by zeros.

When PLEPs are amended or superseded, it is generally helpful to
request reviews from the authors of the original PLEP.

Minor changes to a PLEP that do not affect its meaning or intent
(e.g., formatting changes, fixes to typos, updates to links, minor
rewording to improve clarity, and reversing cosmic ray bit flips) do
not need to go through the full review process, but do require
approval by the Coordinating Committee.

### Submitting a PLEP

All new PLEPs and amendments to PLEPs should be submitted as pull
requests into the PlasmaPy-PLEP repository.  The pull request should be
created while the PLEP is being written to allow for greater
transparency and community input during the writing process.  In this
case, the sponsor should comment on the pull request and inform the
Coordinating Committee when the proposed PLEP is ready for review.

### Review process

When a new PLEP or an amendment to a PLEP is submitted, the
Coordinating Committee should appoint one of its members to be the
PLEP's editor.  The editor is responsible for aiding the sponsor by
making sure that the PLEP follows the accepted standard and
facilitating communication between the sponsor and the Coordinating
Committee.  The editor and sponsor may be the same person.

When the editor agrees that the PLEP is reasonably close to the
accepted standard, then the sponsor, the editor, or another member of
the Coordinating Committee should email the PlasmaPy list to introduce
the PLEP and request community feedback.  

When the editor agrees that the PLEP is reasonably close to the accepted
standard, then the status should be changed to "Discussion" and the pull
request may be accepted.  The sponsor, editor, or a member of the
Coordinating Committee should email the PlasmaPy list to introduce
the PLEP and request community feedback and discussion.  The discussion
should take place through normal communication channels such as the Matrix
channel, on GitHub, and videoconferences.  Important points and relevant
meeting minutes should be recorded as comments on the pull
request so that the community discussion is archived as much as
possible.  During the discussion phase, the sponsor should revise the
PLEP in order to address concerns raised by the community.  The
discussion should ideally continue until a general consensus among the
PlasmaPy community has been reached.  

The Coordinating Committee is tasked with making the final decision on
the PLEP.  A PLEP shall be accepted when approved by at least
two-thirds of the Coordinating Committee.

### PLEP status

The status of a standard or process PLEP may be any of the following:

* **In preparation**: The PLEP is currently being written.  Community
  input is welcome during this phase so that concerns may be addressed
  earlier rather than later.

* **Discussion**: The PLEP is currently being considered and getting
  community feedback before a decision has been made.  This is the
  default status for informational PLEPs that have been completed.

* **Accepted**: The PLEP has been accepted and it will be assigned a
  number and merged into the PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs repository.  A
  decision rationale must be drafted and added to the PLEP by the
  sponsor of the PLEP or by someone appointed by the Coordinating
  Committee.  Features proposed in standard PLEPs may now be
  implemented.  Process PLEPs come into effect when accepted.

* **Implemented**: The feature discussed in a standard PLEP has been
  fully implemented and merged into the main repository.  At least
  half of the Coordinating Committee must agree that the
  implementation (including documentation and tests) is complete.  A
  summary of the implementation process should be added to the PLEP
  when this status is reached.  This summary should include links to
  the issues and pull requests associated with this PLEP that were
  created after the PLEP was accepted.

* **Declined**: The community and Coordinating Committee decided
  against a proposed PLEP.  A decision rationale should be provided by
  the Coordinating Committee.  The PLEP should still be assigned a
  number and merged into the main repository.  It should be noted that
  a future PLEP can supercede this decision.

* **Superseded**: THe PLEP is no longer in effect and has been replaced
  by another PLEP.
  
Informational PLEPs that are being written should have a status of
**in preparation**, and **informational** when it is reasonably complete.
Informational PLEPs may also have a status of **obsolete**.
