# Abstract

PlasmaPy's **Coordinating Committee** (CC) shall oversee the PlasmaPy
project and code development.

# Detailed Description

## Membership of Coordinating Committee

### Limits on number of members

The CC shall consist of at least 4 members and no more than 10
members.  Within these limits, the CC may increase or decrease the
number of directors serving on the CC, including for the purposes of
staggering the terms of members.

### Term of office

All members shall be elected to serve terms of up to two years.
However, the CC may extend the term until a successor has been
elected.  A member may be re-elected at the end of their term.  The
term of a CC member shall begin on January 1 of the first year in
office and end on December 31 of the second year in office, unless the
CC chooses different dates.  The terms should be staggered so that
roughly half of the terms expire each year.

### Vacancies

The CC may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a
previously unfilled CC position, subject to the maximum number of
allowed members specified in this document.  Known upcoming vacancies
shall be advertised no less than 3 months before the vacancy becomes
available.  Unanticipated vacancies shall be advertised as soon as
possible.  All vacancies shall be advertised to the PlasmaPy community
through normal channels of communication such as email lists,
newsletters, and webpages.

### Removal

A member may be removed by a two-thirds majority vote of the full CC
if (a) the member is absent and unexcused from 50% or more meetings of
the CC in a twelve month period; or (b) for cause or for no cause, if
before any meeting of the CC at which a vote on removal will be made
the member of the CC in question is given electronic or written
notification of the CC's intention to discuss their case and is given
the opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the CC.

## Decision-making procedure

### Quorum

A strict majority (>50%) of CC members shall constitute a quorum for a
meeting of the CC.  No official decisions shall be made by the CC at
any meeting at which a quorum is not present.

### Compromise and consensus

The CC should try to find compromises and reach a general consensus
(i.e., the agreement of most CC members) so that the concerns raised
by a minority of CC members can be addressed.

### Voting

An act of the majority of the members of the CC present at a meeting
at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the CC, except as
follows.

A PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposal (PLEP) shall be accepted only if
two-thirds of members of the CC vote to accept it.

Voting by proxy is not allowed.  An act of the CC may allow for a vote
to take place by correspondence (e.g., email).  A time window of at
least a week must be provided for votes to be cast and a quorum will
be defined by the number of votes cast.

*Add a procedure for voting by email or by Matrix or on GitHub maybe?*

### Meetings

The CC shall have at least one regular meeting each quarter at times
and places fixed by the CC.  At each meeting, the time of the
subsequent meeting should be decided or one or more CC members should
be delegated to be responsible for scheduling and organizing the next
meeting.

Special meetings of the CC may be called by any two members of the CC.

Meetings should generally be held remotely through conference calls,
video chats, or text-based chats as decided by the CC.  The CC may
decide to have an in-person meeting as long as there is an option for
remote participation.  The people scheduling a meeting should

At least seven days notice of a meeting of the CC must be provided to
each member of the CC.  This notice must include the time of the
meeting and either the location of the meeting or information on how
to join a remote meeting.

It is recommended but not required that the purpose and agenda of each
meeting be sent out in advance of the meeting.  Every CC member may
add items to the agenda of a meeting.
