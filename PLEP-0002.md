# Abstract

PlasmaPy's **Coordinating Committee** (CC) shall oversee the PlasmaPy
project and code development.

# Detailed Description

## Membership of Coordinating Committee

### Limits on number of members

The CC shall consist of at least 5 members and no more than 10
members.  Within these limits, the CC may increase or decrease the
number of directors serving on the CC, including for the purposes of
staggering the terms of members.

### Term of office

All members shall be elected to serve a maximum of a two-year term;
however, the term may be extended by the CC until a successor has been
elected.  A member may be re-elected at the end of their term.

The term of a CC member shall begin on January 1 of the first year in
office and end on December 31 of the second year of office, unless the
term is extended until such time as a successor has been elected.

### Vacancies

The CC may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a
previously unfilled CC position, subject to the maximum number of
allowed members specified in this document.  Known upcoming vacancies
shall be advertised no less than 3 months before the vacancy becomes
available.  Unanticipated vacancies shall be advertised as soon as
possible.  All vacancies shall be advertised to the PlasmaPy community
through channels of communication such as email lists, newsletters,
and webpages.  The CC should fill vacancies as soon as is reasonable.

### Removal

A member may be removed by a two-thirds majority vote of the full CC
if (a) the member is absent and unexcused from 50% or more meetings of
the CC in a twelve month period; or (b) for cause or for no cause, if
before any meeting of the CC at which a vote on removal will be made
the member of the CC in question is given electronic or written
notification of the CC's intention to discuss their case and is given
the opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the CC.

## Decision-making procedure

### Quorum

A strict majority (>50%) of CC members shall constitute a quorum for a
meeting of the CC.  No official decisions shall be made by the CC at
any meeting at which a quorum is not present.

### Compromise and consensus

The CC should try to find compromises and reach a general consensus
(i.e., the agreement of most CC members) so that the concerns raised
by a minority of CC members can be addressed.

### Majority vote

Except as otherwise specified, an act of the majority of the members
of the CC present at a meeting at which a quorum is present shall be
an act of the CC.  However, the CC should make a reasonable effort to
reach a general consensus and/or find a compromise that address
concerns raised by a minority of votres.

### Absentee voting

Voting by proxy is not allowed.  An act of the CC may allow for a vote
to take place by correspondence (e.g., email).  A time window of at
least a week must be provided for votes to be cast and a quorum will
be defined by the number of votes cast.

### Meetings

The CC shall have at least one regular meeting each quarter at times
and places fixed by the CC.  At least seven days notice of each
meeting must be provided to each member of the CC with information on
the time and place of the meeting. 

Special meetings of the CC may be called by any two members of the CC.
A special meeting must be preceded by at least seven days notice of
each meeting with information on the time and place of the meeting.
The CC members calling the meeting should put reasonable effort into
finding a time that works for most or all CC members.

The CC may decide to hold meetings in-person or through conference
calls, video chats, or text-based chats.  In-person meetings should
allow for remote participation.

It is recommended but not required that the purpose and agenda of each
meeting be sent out in advance of the meeting.
