# Abstract

PlasmaPy's **Coordinating Committee** (CC) shall oversee the PlasmaPy
project and code development.

# Detailed Description

## Membership of Coordinating Committee

### Membership

The CC shall consist of at least 4 members and no more than 12 members.  
Within these limits, the CC may increase or decrease the number of 
directors serving on the CC, including for the purposes of staggering 
the terms of members.  The CC should include not just core members but
also members who work toward community engagement, education, and other
goals of PlasmaPy.  Current and former members of the CC shall be listed 
in [PLEP 
3](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy-PLEPs/blob/master/PLEP-0003.md).

### Term of office

All members shall be elected by the CC to serve terms of up to two 
years. However, the CC may extend the term until a successor has been
elected. A member may be re-elected at the end of their term.  The term 
of a CC member shall begin on January 1 of the first year in office and 
end on December 31 of the second year in office, unless the CC chooses 
different dates.  The terms should be staggered so that roughly half of 
the terms expire each year.

### Vacancies

The CC may fill vacancies or may appoint new members to fill a
previously unfilled CC position, subject to the maximum number of
allowed members specified in this document.  Known upcoming vacancies
should be advertised at least two months before the vacancy becomes
available.  Unanticipated vacancies shall be advertised as soon as
possible.  All vacancies shall be advertised to the PlasmaPy community
through normal channels of communication such as email lists,
newsletters, and webpages.  

### Removal

A member may be removed by a two-thirds majority vote of the full CC
if (a) the member is absent and unexcused from 50% or more meetings of
the CC in a twelve month period; or (b) for cause or for no cause, if
before any meeting of the CC at which a vote on removal will be made
the member of the CC in question is given electronic or written
notification of the CC's intention to discuss their case and is given
the opportunity to be heard at a meeting of the CC.

## Decision-making procedure

### Quorum

A strict majority (>50%) of CC members shall constitute a quorum for a
meeting of the CC.  No official decisions shall be made by the CC at
any meeting at which a quorum is not present.

### Compromise and consensus

The CC should try to find compromises and reach a general consensus
(i.e., the agreement of most CC members) so that the concerns raised
by a minority of CC members can be addressed.

### Voting

Votes of the CC may take place during either a meeting of the CC when a
quorum is present or by using electronic communication.  

An act of the majority of the members of the CC present at a meeting
at which a quorum is present shall be an act of the CC, except as
otherwise indicated.

An act of the CC may occur by a vote taken over email or other forms of
remote communication that are readily available and accessible to all
CC members.  During such votes, all members shall be considered present
(i.e., a majority vote means a majority of all CC members).  Prior to a
vote, there should be a period of discussion related to issue among the
CC (and often the broader PlasmaPy community).  A vote shall begin when
a member of the CC sends a proposal to all members of the CC.  Voting
shall end either when enough members of the CC have voted such that the
outcome has been determined, or seven days after the proposal has been
sent out (whichever comes later).  Members may change their votes up
until the time when the outcome has been determined.

A PlasmaPy Enhancement Proposal (PLEP) shall be accepted only if
two-thirds of all members of the CC vote to accept it.

Voting by proxy is not allowed.

### Meetings

The CC should have at least one regular meeting each quarter at times
and places fixed by the CC, or as needed.  At each meeting, the time of 
the subsequent meeting should be decided or one or more CC members 
should be delegated to be responsible for scheduling and organizing the
next meeting.

Special meetings of the CC may be called by any two members of the CC.

Meetings should generally be held remotely through conference calls,
video chats, or text-based chats as decided by the CC.  The CC may
decide to have an in-person meeting as long as there is an option for
remote participation.  The people scheduling a meeting should make a
reasonable effort to find a time that works for as many CC members as
possible.

At least seven days notice of a meeting of the CC must be provided to
each member of the CC (unless otherwise agreed by all CC members).  This 
notice must include the time of the meeting and either the location of 
the meeting or information on how to join a remote meeting.

It is recommended but not required that the purpose and agenda of each
meeting be sent out in advance of the meeting.  Every CC member may
add items to the agenda of a meeting.

The CC should also hold weekly or biweekly telecons or video conferences
so that the CC and members of the PlasmaPy community may coordinate
code development and other activities.

## Responsibilities of the Coordinating Committee
