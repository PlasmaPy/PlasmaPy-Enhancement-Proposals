## Abstract

The purposes of this PLEP are for PlasmaPy to:

1. Add language to its license in order to protect against software
patents; and

2. Adopt Creative Commons licenses for creative content besides source
code files and code snippers.

## Detailed Description

PlasmaPy began development under the permissive [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause).  This choice
was made to follow the established practice of existing projects such
as [Astropy](http://www.astropy.org/).  The principal advantage of the
BSD license is that it is highly compatible with other licenses.  Code
released under a BSD license can be used by or within codes released
under most permissive and copyleft licenses.

Most modern software licenses include language that protects against
software patents.  The BSD 3-clause license does not explicitly
include such language.  This oversight leaves potential for a
contributor to patent their contribution, and then prohibit use of
thier contribution by the PlasmaPy community.  Plasma physics has a
variety of commercial applications, so it is important to include
protections against software patents.  The first component of this
PLEP is to add the explicit patent grant contained in the [BSD+Patent
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent) to PlasmaPy's
license.

PlasmaPy includes multiple repositories to host creative works other
than software.  Creative Commons licenses are much more appropriate
than open source licenses for creative content.  The second component
of this PLEP is that PlasmaPy adopt the Creative Commons Attribution
4.0 International ([CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) license for most
creative works, excluding source code files and code snippets.

When it is desirable to allow back and forth collaboration with a
large body of work under a Creative Commons ShareAlike license, then
the copyleft Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International
([CC BY-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/))
license shall be adopted.  When appropriate, language will be added
stating that works in these repositories may be incorporated into
large bodies of work under a previous ShareAlike license (such as
[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/)) under that previous
ShareAlike license.

When new repositories are created, they will by default be licensed
under the [main PlasmaPy repository's
license](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/PlasmaPy/blob/master/LICENSE.md)
(the BSD 3-clause license with the patent grant from the BSD+Patent
license) for source code files and code snippets, and under the CC BY
4.0 license for all other creative content.

The Coordinating Committee may adopt different licenses for different
repositories when appropriate, as long as the licenses are on the list
of [OSI approved open source
licenses](https://opensource.org/licenses/category) (or at the very
least unambiguously meet the [definition of open
source](https://opensource.org/osd) as described by OSI).  Existing
open source repositories that are incorporated into PlasmaPy may
continue to be licensed under the existing license.

## Implementation

After receiving the permission of all contributors, the PlasmaPy
license shall be updated to include the following language:

> Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each copyright
> holder and contributor hereby grants to those receiving rights under
> this license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
> royalty-free, irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the
> conditions of this license) patent license to make, have made, use,
> offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,
> where such license applies only to those patent claims, already
> acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by such copyright holder
> or contributor that are necessarily infringed by:
>
>   (a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of copyright
>       holders and non-copyrightable additions of contributors, in
>       source or binary form) alone; or
>
>   (b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work of
>       authorship to which such Contribution(s) was added by such
>       copyright holder or contributor, if, at the time the
>       Contribution is added, such addition causes such combination
>       to be necessarily infringed. The patent license shall not
>       apply to any other combinations which include the
>       Contribution.
>
> Except as expressly stated above, no rights or licenses from any
> copyright holder or contributor is granted under this license,
> whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

The phrase ["All rights
reserved"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_rights_reserved) no
longer has any legal significance and will be removed.  The disclaimer
will not be made using all capital letters because that reduces
readability.

If some contributors do not give permission to add the above language
and have it cover their existing contributions, then it will be stated
whose contributions are not covered by the patent language.

Existing repositories that contain solely creative works will be
updated to include a license file that includes or refers to the CC BY
4.0 license, with the exception that the [Plasma-Education
repository](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/Plasma-Education) will be
covered by the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

Repositories that include both source code and creative works will
include a clause such as:

> Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
> licensed under the BSD 3-clause license with an added patent grant.
> All other content in this project (including content compiled
> directly from source code and code snippets) is licensed under the
> Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

For example, LaTeX code will be covered under the BSD license, while
the document created by compiling that code will be covered under the
CC BY 4.0 license.

Code in newly created repositories will be licensed under the same
license as the main PlasmaPy repository.  Other creative content in
newly created repositories will use CC BY 4.0 license, except as
decided by the Coordinating Committee.

## Backward Compatibility

Previous versions of PlasmaPy will continue to be available under the
original BSD 3-clause license.  Contributions made prior to this will
not be covered by the patent grant except if granted by the person who
made that contribution.

## Alternatives

### Software licensing

- The first alternative is to retain our current BSD 3-clause license
  that does not include a patent grant.  This alternative risks the
  small but nonzero possibility that a contributor could patent their
  contribution and then restrict PlasmaPy from using it.

- The second alternative is to use the [Apache License, Version
  2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) which includes
  specific protections against patents.  However, [the naming of the
  Apache license constitutes cultural
  appropriation](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/660) which
  violates the first bullet point of the Contributor Covenant Code of
  Conduct on "using welcoming and inclusive language."

- Additional alternatives include any of the [open source licenses
  approved by OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/category),
  including the copyleft GNU General Purpose License 3.0.  

### Licensing of creative works

- Alternatives include any of the other [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/).
