## Abstract

Most modern software licenses include language that protects users and
the package against software patents.  PlasmaPy's [BSD 3-clause
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSD-3-Clause) does not
include such a clause.  There is a small but nonzero chance that a
contributor could later patent their contribution, and then prohibit
use of that contribution by PlasmaPy community members.  The first
component of this PLEP is to add the explicit patent grant contained
in the [BSD+Patent
license](https://opensource.org/licenses/BSDplusPatent) that was
recently approved by the Open Source Initiative (OSI).

PlasmaPy includes multiple repositories to host creative works in
addition to (or instead of) software.  Creative Commons licenses are
much more appropriate than open source licenses for creative content.
The second component of this PLEP is to adopt the Creative Commons
Attribution 4.0 International ([CC BY
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)) license for
creative works in most repositories, and the Creative Commons
Attribution-ShareAlike 4.0 International ([CC BY-SA
4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/)) for the
creative works in the [Plasma-Education
repository](https://github.com/PlasmaPy/Plasma-Education).

## Detailed Description




## Implementation

The following text will be added to the existing PlasmaPy license:

> Subject to the terms and conditions of this license, each copyright
> holder and contributor hereby grants to those receiving rights under
> this license a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge,
> royalty-free, irrevocable (except for failure to satisfy the
> conditions of this license) patent license to make, have made, use,
> offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer this software,
> where such license applies only to those patent claims, already
> acquired or hereafter acquired, licensable by such copyright holder
> or contributor that are necessarily infringed by:
>
>   (a) their Contribution(s) (the licensed copyrights of copyright
>       holders and non-copyrightable additions of contributors, in
>       source or binary form) alone; or
>
>   (b) combination of their Contribution(s) with the work of
>       authorship to which such Contribution(s) was added by such
>       copyright holder or contributor, if, at the time the
>       Contribution is added, such addition causes such combination
>       to be necessarily infringed. The patent license shall not
>       apply to any other combinations which include the
>       Contribution.
>
> Except as expressly stated above, no rights or licenses from any
> copyright holder or contributor is granted under this license,
> whether expressly, by implication, estoppel or otherwise.

The phrase "All rights reserved" will be removed because it no longer
has any legal significance, and additional minor formatting changes
will be made.  

Repositories that contain solely creative works will be updated to
include a license file that includes or refers to the CC BY license,
with the exception that the Plasma-Education library will be covered
by the CC BY-SA 4.0 license.

Repositories that include both source code and creative works will
include a clause such as:

> Source code files and code snippets included in this project are
> licensed under the BSD 3-clause license with an added patent grant.
> All other content in this project (including content compiled
> directly from source code and code snippets) is licensed under the
> Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license.

For example, LaTeX code will be covered under the BSD license, while
the document created by compiling that code will be covered under the
CC BY 4.0 license.

## Backward Compatibility

Previous versions of PlasmaPy will continue to be available under the
original BSD 3-clause license.  Contributions made prior to this will
not be covered by the patent grant except if granted 

## Alternatives

### Software licensing

- The first alternative is to retain our current BSD 3-clause license
  that does not include a patent grant.  This alternative risks the
  small but nonzero possibility that a contributor could patent their
  contribution and then restrict PlasmaPy from using it.

- The second alternative is to use the [Apache License, Version
  2.0](https://opensource.org/licenses/Apache-2.0) which includes
  specific protections against patents.  However, [the naming of this
  license constitutes cultural
  appropriation](https://github.com/Quick/Quick/issues/660) which
  violates the first bullet point of the Contributor Covenant Code of
  Conduct on "using welcoming and inclusive language."

- Additional alternatives include any of the [open source licenses
  approved by OSI](https://opensource.org/licenses/category), possibly
  with the addition of the explicit patent grant included the
  [BSD+Patent license]().

### Licensing of creative works

- Alternatives include any of the other [Creative Commons
  licenses](https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/licensing-types-examples/).
