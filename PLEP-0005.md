# Abstract

This PLEP describes the versioning scheme for PlasmaPy core and
affiliated packages, and the anticipated release cycle for the core
package.

# Versioning Specification

PlasmaPy shall have version numbers that are consistent with the
Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) `2.0.0` and [PEP
440](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0440/).

Version numbers for PlasmaPy shall be of the following format:

```MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[{a|b|rc}N][.devM]```

The `MAJOR`, `MINOR`, and `PATCH` version numbers must always be
present.  The pre-release tags given in square brackets are optional,
and are absent for final releases.  The pre-release tags are `a` for
an alpha version, `b` for a beta version, and `rc` for a release
candidate version.  The integer `N` shall initially be `0`.  The
development tag `.devM` will be appended to the version that is being
developed.  The integer `M` shall be the commit number.

Final releases of PlasmaPy shall be of the form `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`.

1. `MAJOR` must be incremented whenever we make incompatible changes to
   the application program interface (API), starting with version
   `1.0.0`.

2. MINOR must be incremented whenever we add backwards-compatible
   functionality.

3. PATCH must be incremented whenever we make backwards-compatible bug
   fixes.

During the initial development phase, `MAJOR` will be `0` so final
releases will have version numbers of the form `0.MINOR.PATCH`.
`MINOR` shall be incremented whenever the public API changes, and
`PATCH` shall be incremented whenever there are backwards-compatible
bug fixes.  The API should be considered unstable and anything may
change at any time during the development phase.

# Release Schedule

Version `0.1.0` of PlasmaPy will be released in early 2018 as a
prototype and developer's preview.  Subsequent development releases
should occur no less frequently than every six months, but may occur
more frequently if important new features are added.  Minor releases
during the development phase shall be supported with patch releases
until the next minor release.

Version `1.0.0` will be released once the PlasmaPy core package has a
stable API that users have begun to depend upon.  Releases should occur
no less frequently than every six months.  A major release should
generally happen every two years.  According to this schedule there
should be about three minor releases between each major release.

Long term support (LTS) releases shall occur roughly once every two
years.  LTS releases shall be supported with maintenance and bug fix
patches for at least two years or until the next LTS release,
whichever takes longer.  The Coordinating Committee may optionally
designate a development release for medium or long term support if
there is significant demand and support for it among PlasmaPy users
and developers.  Version `1.0.0` shall be an LTS release.  Releases
that occur when the major version number is incremented will generally
be LTS releases.  The Coordinating Committee may alter the LTS release
schedule when appropriate (e.g., when major releases occur more or
less frequently than every two years).

# Issues, Pull Requests, and Branches



# Alternatives

- There are [numerous versioning
  schemes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning#Schemes)
  that are used by different software projects.  These schemes are
  generally less standardized than semantic versioning.

# Decision Rationale

*This PLEP is in preparation and has not been decided upon.*

# Appendix: Semantic Versioning Specification (SemVer) 2.0.0

*This section contains the Semantic Version Specification
(SemVer) that was authored by Tom Preston-Werner and shared under a
[CC BY 3.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) license.*

The key words “MUST”, “MUST NOT”, “REQUIRED”, “SHALL”, “SHALL NOT”,
“SHOULD”, “SHOULD NOT”, “RECOMMENDED”, “MAY”, and “OPTIONAL” in this
document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC
2119](http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc2119.html).

1. Software using Semantic Versioning MUST declare a public API. This
   API could be declared in the code itself or exist strictly in
   documentation. However it is done, it should be precise and
   comprehensive.

2. A normal version number MUST take the form X.Y.Z where X, Y, and Z
   are non-negative integers, and MUST NOT contain leading zeroes. X
   is the major version, Y is the minor version, and Z is the patch
   version. Each element MUST increase numerically. For instance:
   1.9.0 -> 1.10.0 -> 1.11.0.

3. Once a versioned package has been released, the contents of that
   version MUST NOT be modified. Any modifications MUST be released as
   a new version.

4. Major version zero (0.y.z) is for initial development. Anything may
   change at any time. The public API should not be considered stable.

5. Version 1.0.0 defines the public API. The way in which the version
   number is incremented after this release is dependent on this
   public API and how it changes.

6. Patch version Z (x.y.Z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if only
   backwards compatible bug fixes are introduced. A bug fix is defined
   as an internal change that fixes incorrect behavior.

7. Minor version Y (x.Y.z | x > 0) MUST be incremented if new,
   backwards compatible functionality is introduced to the public
   API. It MUST be incremented if any public API functionality is
   marked as deprecated. It MAY be incremented if substantial new
   functionality or improvements are introduced within the private
   code. It MAY include patch level changes. Patch version MUST be
   reset to 0 when minor version is incremented.

8. Major version X (X.y.z | X > 0) MUST be incremented if any
   backwards incompatible changes are introduced to the public API. It
   MAY include minor and patch level changes. Patch and minor version
   MUST be reset to 0 when major version is incremented.

9. A pre-release version MAY be denoted by appending a hyphen and a
   series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the patch
   version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII alphanumerics and
   hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be empty. Numeric
   identifiers MUST NOT include leading zeroes. Pre-release versions
   have a lower precedence than the associated normal version. A
   pre-release version indicates that the version is unstable and
   might not satisfy the intended compatibility requirements as
   denoted by its associated normal version. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha,
   1.0.0-alpha.1, 1.0.0-0.3.7, 1.0.0-x.7.z.92.

10. Build metadata MAY be denoted by appending a plus sign and a
    series of dot separated identifiers immediately following the
    patch or pre-release version. Identifiers MUST comprise only ASCII
    alphanumerics and hyphen [0-9A-Za-z-]. Identifiers MUST NOT be
    empty. Build metadata SHOULD be ignored when determining version
    precedence. Thus two versions that differ only in the build
    metadata, have the same precedence. Examples: 1.0.0-alpha+001,
    1.0.0+20130313144700, 1.0.0-beta+exp.sha.5114f85.

11. Precedence refers to how versions are compared to each other when
    ordered. Precedence MUST be calculated by separating the version
    into major, minor, patch and pre-release identifiers in that order
    (Build metadata does not figure into precedence). Precedence is
    determined by the first difference when comparing each of these
    identifiers from left to right as follows: Major, minor, and patch
    versions are always compared numerically. Example: 1.0.0 < 2.0.0 <
    2.1.0 < 2.1.1. When major, minor, and patch are equal, a
    pre-release version has lower precedence than a normal
    version. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0. Precedence for two
    pre-release versions with the same major, minor, and patch version
    MUST be determined by comparing each dot separated identifier from
    left to right until a difference is found as follows: identifiers
    consisting of only digits are compared numerically and identifiers
    with letters or hyphens are compared lexically in ASCII sort
    order. Numeric identifiers always have lower precedence than
    non-numeric identifiers. A larger set of pre-release fields has a
    higher precedence than a smaller set, if all of the preceding
    identifiers are equal. Example: 1.0.0-alpha < 1.0.0-alpha.1 <
    1.0.0-alpha.beta < 1.0.0-beta < 1.0.0-beta.2 < 1.0.0-beta.11 <
    1.0.0-rc.1 < 1.0.0.
