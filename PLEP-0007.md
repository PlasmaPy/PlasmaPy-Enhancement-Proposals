As PlasmaPy grows in terms of size and different subpackages specialize, it will
require more and more complex dependencies to function. As things stand at the
time of this PLEP's writing, this will mean installing more and more complex,
often C/Fortran based packages that not everyone will be likely to use.
C/C++/Cython based `h5py` package, that needs to be installed even if the user
intends never to use that functionality.

From a design standpoint, there are two obvious, broad possible solutions to
this issue:

1. Consciously decide to keep all dependencies required
2. Make several of the dependencies optional

It should be pointed out that much of this PLEP may be obvious to many, however,
coming into this I did not know much about the best practices for shipping
optional packages and it seems best to summarize my research into this subject.

# Pros and cons of both solutions

This entire PLEP was caused by a very good discussion between @cadair and
@dstansby [on Matrix](https://matrix.to/#/!hkWCiyhQyxiYJlUtKF:matrix.org/$15343221501326144UDvSi:matrix.org).

Summarizing this and later discussions in terms of advantages and disadvantages,
for each solution:
* #1 places a lower burden on maintainers than #2 in setting things up
* #1 likewise causes less issues for users who install the minimal, required set
  of packages and then realize functionality doesn't work - and for maintainers
  helping those users
* #1 disadvantages users with bad internet connections (due to long download times)
* #1 disadvantages users with weaker computers (due to longer compilation times
    for packages like `h5py`, which needs to build the entire HDF5 library)
* #2 allows people with incompatible setups  to sidestep certain issues. For
  example, suppose dependent library LIBNAME is not available on a Mac - if it
  were required and imported at the module level, PlasmaPy could not be ran on a
  Mac!


# How do other packages do this?
* Astropy has a [few required
  dependencies](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#requirements) and
  multiple optional ones.
  They are simply imported within appropriate functions.
* SunPy has [a few required dependencies](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/installation/advanced.html#sunpy-s-requirements)
  and a few optional ones.   
  Their `conda-forge` package installs all of the required and optional dependencies.
* Pandas has [multiple optional dependencies](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/install.html#optional-dependencies)
  that are mostly imported within functions. Some of them have `try: (...) except ImportError: installation_instruction_warning()` blocks.` `
* Numpy and Scipy amazingly seem to have no Python dependencies besides optional linear algebra
  libraries (such as LAPACK).

# Technical considerations for making dependencies optional

From a technical standpoint, it is not difficult to turn dependencies optional.
TODO

# User-facing considerations (`pip install` etc.)

Setuptools provides "extras" - sets of optional dependencies for particular features
that can be specified in the package's `setup.py`. More can be found about those
[at this link](https://setuptools.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setuptools.html#declaring-extras-optional-features-with-their-own-dependencies).

SunPy provides a very nice example of using that to allow `pip install`ing the package with various
sets of requirements, [as seen here](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/guide/installation/advanced.html#using-pip).
To summarize,

Their implementation of that particular feature [can be found here]( https://github.com/sunpy/sunpy/blob/2fe3d1782f2a31bf2a212f392e795292f7cac6e7/setup.py#L108-L114).
 Also, from [Astropy documentation](http://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/install.html#requirements):

 > The --no-deps flag is optional, but highly recommended if you already have Numpy installed, since otherwise pip will sometimes try to “help” you by upgrading your Numpy installation, which may not always be desired.

# Our current requirements.txt file
As it stands, our `requirements.txt` file looks like this:
```
numpy (>= 1.13)
scipy (>= 0.19)
astropy (>= 2.0)
mpmath (>= 1.0.0)
h5py (>= 2.8)
lmfit (>= 0.9.7)
matplotlib (>= 2.0)
cython (>= 0.27.2)
colorama (>= 0.3)
```

Of those packages the following are good candidates for required packages:

* `astropy` is imported 88 times, mostly for the `units` subpackage.
* `import numpy` is seen 59 times, being a basic workhorse for numerical computation in Python. `numpy.pi` is also imported about 3 times.
* `scipy`'s `integrate`, `optimize`, `integrate` and `special` subpackages are imported 9 times.
* `cython` is not directly imported at all just yet, but is used at build/setup time and is, in all honesty, likely a question for a future PLEP.


And these could potentially become optional packages:
* `mpmath` is 0.5MB and is used once in `mathematics` for the polylogarithmic function.
* `h5py` is 2MB+ and is imported once in `classes.sources.openpmd_hdf5`.
* `lmfit` is 1.6MB imported once in `quantum` for a chemical potential minimization calculation.
* `matplotlib` is 12MB+ and is imported for visualization functions in `species` and in `langmuir`. It is also broadly used in examples.
* `colorama` is only 20kB and is used once in `pytest_helpers`.
