# Abstract

The current implementation of PlasmaPy's `Plasma` object does not adequately fulfill the intended use case.
Plasma physics is a broad discipline which makes use of many different kinds of data structure from a variety of sources and a variety of purposes.
If PlasmaPy is to provide useful tools for all plasma physicists, its core data object therefore needs to be appropriately flexible.
This PLEP therefore presents a new more general framework for the `Plasma` object.

# Detailed Description

## Issues with current Plasma object

The existing Plasma class was written primarily for use in simulations and can only be instantiated with `astropy` Quantities as input.
This is largely because it was originally intended for use with an entirely different package and flexibility was not a significant issue.
So far no major problems have arisen from this lack of flexibility, but as PlasmaPy grows its user-base and its functionality it will have to be able to load, store and analyse a wide variety of different kinds of plasma.
The `Plasma` class as it is currently written will not be able to do these things.

## Proposed solution

There are a few ways in which PlasmaPy might deal with multiple different kinds of plasma.
One would be to implement multiple classes with different methods of instantiation and with attributes and methods appropriate for the kind of plasma.
Another would be to continue using a single class but to build in all functionality needed for every kind of plasma we would wish to be able to work with.

Of these options, both have some drawbacks.
The latter would result in the class being extremely difficult to develop and maintain, and likely also problematic to use productively.
On the other hand, the former allows each class to be more focused, but requires maintaining them all separately.
It would also introduce a slightly different user experience for each different type of plasma.

The proposed solution is a compromise between these two methods, similar to that used by [SunPy](sunpy.org) for its core [Map](http://docs.sunpy.org/en/stable/code_ref/map.html) object.
In this model each kind of plasma would have its own subclass, allowing these to provide functionality specific to that plasma.
The user interface to these classes would be handled exclusively by a `Plasma` metaclass which would also define common or default functionality.
When instantiated, the metaclass would create and return the appropriate subclass based on the input.

This approach gives the advantages of reducing the development and maintenance burden compared to using multiple completely separate classes by centralising common functionality, while also allowing arbitrarily specific plasma subclasses.
In addition to these development benefits, presenting the user with a single interface for any plasma reduces cognitive overhead for learners and increases the reusability of code.
