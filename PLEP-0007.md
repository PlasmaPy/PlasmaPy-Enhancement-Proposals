# Abstract

The current implementation of PlasmaPy's Plasma object does not adequately fulfill the intended use case.
It is written primarily for use in simulations and is instantiated with direct input of data arrays.
However, plasma physics is a broad discipline which makes use of many different kinds of data structure from a variety of sources and a variety of purposes.
If PlasmaPy is to provide useful tools for all plasma physicists, its core data object needs to be appropriately flexible.
This PLEP therefore presents a new more general framework for the Plasma object.
