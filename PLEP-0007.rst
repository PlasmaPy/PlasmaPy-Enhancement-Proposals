Abstract
========

This PLEP defines the top-level structure of ``PlasmaPy`` (i.e.
``plasmapy.<subpackage>``).  Its intent is to name the top-level
sub-packages and define the general scope of the code they encompass.
Sub-package details are left to be defined in package focused
PLEPs, which should *NOT* conflict with this PLEP.  This
structure should help developers decided where new code should be
placed and keep the top-level namespace from getting bloated.  If
new code does NOT fall within the current framework, then this PLEP
needs to be modified/updated accordingly before any new top-level
sub-packages are created.

Detailed Description
====================

Why?
----

By defining a top-level sub-package namespace, developers are better
directed to where code can be added and the ``PlasmaPy``
**Coordinating Committee** can better manage package bloat.

Top-Level Sub-Packages

| :PLEP:                                                                       |
| :scope:                                                                      |
|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages focused on providing  |
|   analysis techniques that can be applied to data collected from a variety   |
|   of sources (simulation, experimental, space, etc.).                        |
|                                                                              |
|   The focus of an analysis routine should be made as broad as possible.      |
|   When the routine's functionality becomes highly-tailored to its            |
|   application, then it should be placed into an appropriate explicit         |
|   namespace.                                                                 |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|   .. _diagnostics:                                                           |
|                                                                              |
| **diagnostics**                                                              |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :directory: ``./plasmapy/diagnostics/``                                      |
| :access: ``plasmapy.diagnostics``                                            |
| :PLEP:                                                                       |
| :scope:                                                                      |
|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages that fully defines    |
|   the parameters of a "diagnostic."  A "diagnostic" is any data collecting   |
|   instrument ranging from experimental probes, like Langmuir and magnetic    |
|   flux probes, to analogous synthetic diagnostics for simulations.           |
|                                                                              |
|   Tools in this package do not define any analysis routines, but focus on    |
|   defining probe characteristics/calibrations that can be seamlessly passed  |
|   to ``plasmapy.analysis`` routines.                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   A ``Diagnostic`` class should fully define its diagnostic characteristics  |
|   and provide access to its most relevant analysis tools found in            |
|   ``plasmapy.analysis``.                                                     |

| :scope:                                                                      |
|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages dedicated to solving  |
|   various plasma dispersion relations.                                       |
|                                                                              |
|   All dispersion solvers defined in this sub-package should be accessible    |
|   through a dispersion solver factory class, ``DispersionSolver``.           |

|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages that provide          |
|   mathematical and scientific formulas for calculating physical parameters   |
|   of various plasmas.                                                        |

|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages that fully defines    |
|   the properties of a "particle."  A "particle" can come in many forms       |
|   ranging from a traditional particle (electron, ion, atom, etc.) to more    |
|   exotic types like dust particles, dimensionless particles for simulations, |
|   super-particles for simulations, etc.                                      |
|                                                                              |
|   All types of particles in this sub-package should be able to be            |
|   instantiated through a particle factory class, ``Particle``.               |

|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages that fully defines a  |
|   plasma.  This would include the plasma's species constituents and physical |
|   parameters (like temperature, boundary conditions, magnetic fields, etc.). |
|                                                                              |
|   Any tools that go into defining a plasma or its environment (e.g. a field  |
|   solver) should be included in a sub-package withing ``plasmapy.plasma``.   |

|   A collection of functions, classes, and sub-packages focused on            |
|   interfacing with simulations and/or running simulations.                   |
|                                                                              |
|   If a new feature falls under the scope of the ``analysis`` and/or          |
|   ``diagnostics`` sub-packages, then the feature should be included one of   |
|   respective packages.  For example, a synthetic diagnostic should be        |
|   included in the ``plasmapy.diagnostics`` sub-package.                      |

|   A collection of "utility" functions and classes to help us write           |
|   (what we try to think of as) clean, readable, and informative code.        |

|   This collection does not provide any physics tools, instead it is          |
