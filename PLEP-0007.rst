Abstract
========

This PLEP defines the top-level structure of ``PlasmaPy`` (i.e.
``plasmapy.<subpackage>``).  Its intent is to name the top-level
sub-packages and define the general scope of the code they encompass.
Sub-package details are left to be defined in package focused
PLEPs, which should *NOT* conflict with this PLEP.  This
structure should help developers decided where new code should be
placed and keep the top-level namespace from getting bloated.  If
new code does NOT fall within the current framework, then this PLEP
needs to be modified/updated accordingly before any new top-level
sub-packages are created.

Detailed Description
====================

Why?
----

By defining a top-level sub-package namespace, developers are better
directed to where code can be added and the ``PlasmaPy``
**Coordinating Committee** can better manage package bloat.

|                                                                              |
| **addons**                                                                   |

| :access: ``plasmapy.addons``                                                 |
| :PLEP:                                                                       |

|   The ``addons`` sub-package is intended to be a plugin location to allow    |
|   3rd party users to extent the capabilities of `PlasmaPy`_.                 |
|                                                                              |
|   `PlasmaPy`_'s primary goal is to provide common functionality to the       |
|   plasma community as a whole and avoids getting too focused on              |
|   resources/functionality that are specific to a research group, instrument, |
|   laboratory, etc.  However, we do see the benefit of having this            |
|   functionality available in the `PlasmaPy`_ ecosystem.  This ``addons``     |
|   entry point allows for the PlasmaPy community to develop separate          |
|   open-source distributions that extend the functionality of ``plasmapy``.   |
|                                                                              |
|   .. note:: How to extend `PlasmaPy`_ by adding to ``plasmapy.addons`` will  |
|             be covered in a future PLEP.                                     |

|                                                                              |

| :scope:                                                                      |
|   A sub-package focused on providing analysis techniques that can be         |
|   applied to data collected from a variety of sources (simulation,           |
|   experimental, space, etc.).                                                |
|                                                                              |
|   The focus of an analysis routine should be made as broad as possible.      |
|   When the routine's functionality becomes highly-tailored to its            |
|   application, then it should be placed into an explicitly appropriate       |
|   namespace.  For example, linear, langmuir, magnetic-flux, etc. analysis    |
|   tools should be placed in their respective namespaces.                     |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| .. _diagnostics:                                                             |

|   A sub-package that fully defines the parameters of a "diagnostic."  A      |
|   "diagnostic" is any data collecting instrument ranging from experimental   |
|   probes, like Langmuir and magnetic flux probes, to analogous synthetic     |
|   diagnostics for simulations.                                               |
|                                                                              |
|   Tools in this package do not define any analysis routines, but focus on    |
|   defining probe characteristics/calibrations that can be seamlessly passed  |
|   to ``plasmapy.analysis`` routines.                                         |
|                                                                              |
|   A "``Diagnostic``" class should fully define its diagnostic                |
|   characteristics and provide access to its most relevant analysis tools     |
|   found in ``plasmapy.analysis``.                                            |

|   A sub-package dedicated to solving various plasma dispersion relations.    |
|                                                                              |

|   A sub-package that provides mathematical and scientific formulas for       |
|   calculating physical parameters of various plasmas.  This is inspired by,  |
|   and akin to, the `NRL Plasma Formulary`_.                                  |

|   A sub-package that fully defines the properties of a "particle."  A        |
|   "particle" can come in many forms ranging from a traditional particle      |
|   (electron, ion, atom, etc.) to more exotic types like dust particles,      |
|   dimensionless particles for simulations, super-particles for simulations,  |

|   A sub-package that fully defines a plasma.  This would include the         |
|   plasma's species constituents and physical parameters (like temperature,   |
|   boundary conditions, magnetic fields, etc.).                               |

|   If a new feature falls under the scope of the ``analysis`` and/or          |
|   ``diagnostics`` sub-packages, then the feature should be included one of   |

|   A collection of "utility" functions and classes to help us write           |
|   (what we try to think of as) clean, readable, and informative code.        |
|                                                                              |
|   This collection does not provide any physics tools, instead it is          |
|   focused on providing package development tools.                            |
|                                                                              |
|   .. note:: Utilities focused on running and developing tests should be      |
|             placed in ``plasmapy.tests`` instead.                            |
